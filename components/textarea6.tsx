                    <div> <p className="w-75 ms-5 mt-3"> The offer can either be: an “open stock inventory”, meaning you can select any sizes you want from the seller stock with of course a minimum quantity imposed by the seller (if he wants to), or a “buy all /take all offer”, which means that the seller wants you to buy all the quantities in that specific model. Usually “buy all deals” have a higher discounted purchase price. Keep in mind, once you place an order on an open stock model, the stock is live and updated right away for the next buyer, which will reflect less quantities in the inventory...until it reaches a: “sold out” status. </p>

NO charges will be done unless orders are APPROVED ! We created a dashboard for buyers so you can see all the information you need: invoice number, tracking number, carrier /shipper, pdf downloadable invoices etc...Now, you have your own excel accounting sheet with you all the time. </p>
