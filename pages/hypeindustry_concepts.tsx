                        <p className="w-75 ps-5 ms-3 mt-3"> In a utopian marketplace, the best option would be to move a bunch of footwear/apparel or else, in bulk (one shot), to: another reseller, store or wholesaler somewhere on planet earth.

                            <br /> <br /> Well, there are no B2B marketplaces anywhere that deal with: limited/ hyped goods, or a marketplace where stores (with no brand account) & reseller could buy from (in bulk prices footwear, apparel, accessories) without any boundaries or questions! So let's try and create that platform: so other store owners & resellers/wholesalers worldwide could profit from! </p>


                    </div>

                        <h2 className=" text-dark pt-5  ps-2 ms-3">Reality</h2>
                        <p className=" pt-4 ps-2 ms-3"> Stores are flooded with quantities of the same items, so what do they do? They flip them on well known resell platform/marketplace; and we are all very familiar with these marketplaces... . How can you sell some Yeezys or Nike, when buyers/bidders are offering a price of 20-35% under retail? Simple, if you are not the store yourself or a person who bought them at roughly 35% to 40% off retail... then forget it!
                            <br /> <br /> <b> So, as a store owner, we see 3 options :</b> <br /><br /> 1. Sell all your sleeping inventory on certain platforms one by one etc. (and for sure , some models will not even sell ...so it’s a loss).Shipping will take a while, and you are wasting time & labor...
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div className="col-md">
                        <img src="P2Img5.png " className="img-fluid float-start pt-5" alt="" />

                    </div>

                </div> </div>

            <div className="container mt-5 pt-5">
                <div className="row ">

                    </div>

                    <div className="col-md ">

                        <p className="pt-2"> 2. Wholesale them to some entity or reseller you trust.But again they might only want to buy the good and the average stuff, that they can flip.

                            <br /> <br />  3. Last but not least : Sell them on a platform in bulk anonymously, with or without a discount ! Allowing your Hyped or general merchandise release inventory to reach multiple stores/resellers in the USA and worldwide . Forget the classic individual B2C (business to consumer) model and , aim at other stores/ wholesalers .The Hype around the footwear, Apparel, Accessory resell market is wide and active! There are many options out there that need to be exploited!</p>

                        <h4> FREEDOM</h4>

                        <p>Freedom for Stores/Resellers to list in bulk any inventory they want at any time they want! Inventory should sell faster this way! Better than offering a 10%-35% off coupons on their website and selling them one item at a time... let’s move the inventory ASAP! Stores are not museums: Boxes, tape, rent,electricity bill, payroll: those have a cost!</p>

                        <p>This option (for the top buyers only) allows you to re-flip a bundle or amount of items ( by adding a margin per pair) ,you just purchased , and flip it back on our platform for a limited time (1 hour window)!

                        <h4> BRAND INTEGRITY</h4>

                        <p>Reputable brands dislike to see their product sell for significantly under retail and doing so, may cause stores to lose their accounts.</p>
